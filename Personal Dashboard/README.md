# Personal Dashboard
### A Chromium extension that creates a random nature-related background image for each new tab, showing your actual time in the middle, the author of the image in the down-left corner, some Doge-coin information in the top-left corner, and your current weather in the top-right corner.

## Technologies used
This extension is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Skills
I've made this project mainly to practice my JavaScript skills,
mainly some concepts about Promises, but also to reinforce
my HTML & CSS skills and Chromium extensions development.
