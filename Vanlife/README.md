# Vanlife
### A Single Page Application for Vanlife that allows users to show a list of Vans. There is also an authentication system (with just one test user) that allows you to get to the "Hosts" page where you can see your profile selling statistics, your selling Vans (and info about the reviews, the income and a whole dashboard), info about them, etc. Only if you are logged in. And also a filter in the Vans main page to filter Van styles.
