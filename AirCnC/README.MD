# AirCnC
### A *responsive* webpage based on AirBnB, but to rent cats and dogs.

## Technologies used
This webpage is made with CSS & HTML, and some JavaScript
with JQuery to add a **lightbox effect to the bottom
images.**

## Skills
I made this project to reinforce some of my **responsive design**
skills, learn the use of that **lightbox** library, and also to 
**build projects based on a previous made design**, apart 
from other HTML & CSS skills.
