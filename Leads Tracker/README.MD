# Leads Tracker
A Chromium extension that allows you to track leads from LinkedIn and other websites.

It **allows you to save your active tab and any input note** that you want with the respective buttons,
and then **you can access them from the extension popup by clicking in the elements on the list, as they are saved as links.**

Its main use case is to save leads, but **it can be used to save any link and note that you want.**

It also has a `DELETE ALL` button that allows you to **delete all the saved links and notes when double-clicked.**

## More Info
The project uses `localStorage` to store the links and notes, so **they will be saved even if you close the browser or restart your computer.**

## Skills
I've made this project to learn a little bit about 
Chromium extensions development and to reinforce my JavaScript skills.
