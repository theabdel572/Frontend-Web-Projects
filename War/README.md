# War
### The War cards game made in a simplistic way and rules (without the war fight features, among others). [Click here for more info about the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game))

## Technologies
The game is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Skills
I've made this project to practice my JavaScript skills,
and reinforce some concepts like APIs, Promises, callbacks,
and Async/Await.
