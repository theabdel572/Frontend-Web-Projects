# Frontend Web Projects
### This repository contains a collection of some of my personal Frontend Web Projects for learning and practising.

## Repository Structure
***
The repository structure is basically **some folders, 
where the projects are stored**, and a folder called 
`Basic Projects`, where I store some basic projects that 
I made for learning and practising.  

I thought it would be a good idea to publish also the 
most basic projects that I did, just in 
case there's some skill or code that might be
interesting to see on there.

In each project folder, there's a `README.md` file
that contains a brief description of the project,
and explains some skills acquired or practised
while doing it.
